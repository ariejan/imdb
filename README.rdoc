== Installation

    $ gem install imdb

== Documentation

This README and generated RDoc documentation are available from http://ariejan.github.com/imdb/

== Running tests

You'll need rspec and fakeweb installed to run the specs.

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake spec

Although not recommended, you may run the specs against the live imdb.com 
website. This will make a lot of calls to imdb.com, use it wisely.

    $ LIVE_TEST=true bundle exec rake spec

To update the packaged fixtures files with actual imdb.com samples, use the
fixtures:refresh rake task

    $ bundle exec rake fixtures:refresh
